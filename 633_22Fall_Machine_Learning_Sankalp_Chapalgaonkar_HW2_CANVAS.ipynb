At 𝜖 0, the algothm becomes fully greedy as it chooses next greedy move with probability 1. As the Q table values are initialised to 0, we do not posses much information.  Also, the reward is 100 for only states near to s2 such as s1, s6 and rest all states have rewards as 0. Thus the algorithm tends to oscillate between the states which are not near s2.\n",
